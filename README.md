# Reading-JSON-files-in-Python
This repo contains codes to read JSON files into Python


JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a text format for storing and transporting data. It is “self-describing” and easy to understand. JASON files can be loaded in Python. Two methods are used here: first loading the data using pandas DataFrame and then using the python ‘open() file’ function.
